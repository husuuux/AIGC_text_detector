The paramountcy of controlled transport for energy and informational transactions persists as a formidable challenge within the physical sciences, particularly emanating from complexities in modulating their physical vectors. While the governance of electrons and photons has entered a realm of procedural routine, the meticulous control of atomic vibrations—quantized as phonons—remains an intricate endeavor. The centrality of phonons, not only in the chaotic transport of energy manifest as heat but also within the domain of ordered sound waves, propounds persistent dilemmas. An inherent proclivity of phonons to engage in coupling—both amongst themselves and with alternate degrees of freedom—instigates a degradation of their encapsulated energy or informational content. The recent advent of mechanisms capable of reversing these couplings, and thereby regimenting atomic motion, illuminates a pathway toward enhanced control, diminishing parasitic losses, and concurrently, transfiguring phonons into viable informational carriers.

Dynamical influences emerge as a pivotal, albeit traditionally under-scrutinized, facet of this control, with static devices demonstrating palpable insufficiencies amidst fluctuating external conditions. The incorporation of dynamical control not only instills a requisite flexibility and versatility within phononic systems but also fundamentally predicates upon the employment of tunable materials. These materials, characterized by physical properties that yield to external signaling, underscore the essentiality of dynamical tuning, which inherently exhibits sensitivity to the relative frequencies of the tuning signal and the regulated phonons.

In this dissertation, an intuitive framework navigating through the temporal modulation regimes is meticulously developed. Within the domain of low-frequency tuning, phonons are enabled to adapt adiabatically to modifications within the material. A cornucopia of signals can be modulated—both temporally and spatially—to finely tune phonon transport within this regime. An adiabatic perspective is applied to assiduously analyze dynamical effects intrinsic to thermal cloaks. Conversely, tuning signals in proximal resonance with a particular phonon mode can incite resonant couplings, catalyzing a hybridization capable of inducing pronounced alterations in phonon properties. This hybridization concept is adroitly applied to the formulation of a rigorously nonreciprocal phononic computer, utilizing magneto-acoustic materials, and exhibiting the potential to eclipse conventional computers in designated tasks.

Navigating into the realm of high-frequency territories, phonons manifest a predisposition to respond perturbatively to modifications within the tuning signal. Although this regime predominantly circumscribes to optical control, it concurrently unveils innovative avenues for control. Pursuing an alternative modality to optical coupling, a model delineating inverse acousto-optics—construed as the modulation of the speed of sound with optical intensity—and dynamical phonon localization, is judiciously developed.
